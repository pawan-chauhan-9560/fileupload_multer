Time management refers to the process of planning and controlling how much time to spend on specific activities. Good time management enables individuals to prioritize tasks and spend the most time on what matters most. It involves setting goals, making decisions, and allocating time wisely. Many professionals struggle with managing time, often feeling overwhelmed by an endless list of tasks, but learning to manage time can make a significant difference in achieving success.

Time management refers to the process of planning and controlling how much time to spend on specific activities. Good time management enables individuals to prioritize tasks and spend the most time on what matters most. It involves setting goals, making decisions, and allocating time wisely.
